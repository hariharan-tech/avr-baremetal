# AVR ATMEGA328P Baremetal
## Motivation

So I started this quest on doing Baremetal programming of AVR micro-controllers just using

- `avr-gcc` for compilation and object, elf file creation
- `avr-objcopy` for creating hex file from elf file
- `avrdude` and `arduino` programmer for flashing the chip.
- `make` for automating the build, hex file generation process and flashing purposes.

## Working Environment

- Iâ€™m building these projects in Ubuntu 22 Linux. (Hence the documentation will contain information on how to replicate the projects here in Debian based Linux OS systems.
